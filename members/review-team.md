# Clever-ISA Review Team

## Charter of the Clever-ISA Review Team

The Clever-ISA Review Team shall be chartered to review Actions perform on Clever-ISA Project repositories. 

## Members

The Clever-ISA Review Team may recommend new members be appointed to the Maintenance Team. Once a recommendation is made, the new member may be appointed to the Review Team by the Maintenance Team.

Members may be removed from the Review Team by the Maintenance Team. The remaining Members of the Review Team may petition the Maintenance Team to remove a Member.

## Raising or Second Concerns during Review

Any member of the Clever-ISA Review Team may Raise or Second a Concern during a Review and Comment Period.

Once a concern is Raised or Seconded, the Review Team must approve the completion of the Review and Comment Period.

## Consensus

The Review Team shall operate by consensus decision making. For actions that are not given to individual members, a Member of the Maintenance Team may raise the action, which should then be reviewed by all Members of the team. 

The Action is taken once the required approval threshold has been reached, no outstanding objections have been made by a member of the team, and one of the following has occured:
1. All Members have approved the action, or
2. At least 5 days have passed since the approval threshold has been reached.

The Required Number of Approvals before an action can be approved depends on the number of Members on the Team:
* 6 or fewer members: 2/3s of the Members of the Team,
* 7 to 15 members: 3 fewer than the number of members of the Team,
* 15 or more members: 5 fewer than the number of members of the Team, or 12 members, whichever is greater.

If a substantive objection is raised by a Member of the Team, it stays approval of the action until it is withdrawn by the member, or overruled. An Objection may be overruled by all other members of the Team affirmatively voting to overrule the objection.
