# Clever-ISA Maintenace Team

## Charter of the Clever-ISA Maintenance Team

The Clever-ISA Maintenace Team shall be chartered to perform maintenance tasks for the Clever-ISA Project.

The Maintenance Team is responsible for performing all non-destructive actions to repositories managed by the Clever-ISA Project, including:
* Managing the repositories, performing triage tasks, and merging approved proposals,
* Approving the Initiation of any Balloting Process initiated by any Working Group,
* Charting a Working Group to manage specific parts of the Clever-ISA Project, approving new members of each Working Group and of the Review Team,
* Removing Members from Working Groups,
* Taking any other action, in accordance with the appropriate processes, not otherwise given explicitly to any Team or Working Group.

## Membership of the Clever-ISA Maintenance Team

The Clever-ISA Maintenance Team may admit new members into the team by consensus. Additionally, the Team may remove members as necessary to maintain order by a unanimous vote of the remaining members.

Each Member of the Clever-ISA Maintenance Team may perform the following actions the Maintenace Team is responsible for, with or without the consensus of the whole Team:
* Any Triage or Repository Management task,
* Approving a Member to be appointed to a Working Group by consensus of the Working Group,
* Approving the Initiation of any Balloting Process initiated by any Working Group.

Notwithstanding the above, any Member of the Team may request that a particular action a Member would otherwise be able to take on their own be subject to approval by consensus, in which case that particular action may not be performed until consensus is obtained, but this shall not preclude any future action from being performed by a Member of the Team.

## Consensus

The Maintenance Team shall operate by consensus decision making. For actions that are not given to individual members, a Member of the Maintenance Team may raise the action, which should then be reviewed by all Members of the team. 

The Action is taken once the required approval threshold has been reached, no outstanding objections have been made by a member of the team, and one of the following has occured:
1. All Members have approved the action, or
2. At least 5 days have passed since the approval threshold has been reached.

The Required Number of Approvals before an action can be approved depends on the number of Members on the Team:
* 6 or fewer members: 2/3s of the Members of the Team,
* 7 to 15 members: 3 fewer than the number of members of the Team,
* 15 or more members: 5 fewer than the number of members of the Team, or 12 members, whichever is greater.

If a substantive objection is raised by a Member of the Team, it stays approval of the action until it is withdrawn by the member, or overruled. An Objection may be overruled by all other members of the Team affirmatively voting to overrule the objection.
