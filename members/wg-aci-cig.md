Any Action granted to the ACI Core Interest Group shall be non-exclusive as to the Maintenance Team. 

## Membership of the ACI Core Interest Group

The Initial Membership of the ACI Core Interest Group shall be set by the Maintenance Team, and subsequent changes shall also be conducted by the Maintenance Team but changes should not be made without consent or petition of the Maintenance Team.

## Consensus

The ACI Core Interest Group shall operate by consensus decision making. For actions that are not given to individual members, a Member of the ACI Core Interest Group may raise the action, which should then be reviewed by all Members of the Working Group. 

The Action is taken once the required approval threshold has been reached, no outstanding objections have been made by a member of the Working Group, and one of the following has occured:
1. All Members have approved the action, or
2. At least 5 days have passed since the approval threshold has been reached.

The Required Number of Approvals before an action can be approved depends on the number of Members on the Working Group:
* 6 or fewer members: 2/3s of the Members of the Working Group,
* 7 to 15 members: 3 fewer than the number of members of the Working Group,
* 15 or more members: 5 fewer than the number of members of the Working Group, or 12 members, whichever is greater.

If a substantive objection is raised by a Member of the Working Group, it stays approval of the action until it is withdrawn by the member, or overruled. An Objection may be overruled by all other members of the Working Group affirmatively voting to overrule the objection.
