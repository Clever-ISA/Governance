# Amendments to Governance

## Applicability

This Document Applies to the Clever-ISA Project Governance.

## Amendments

Any Proposed Change to Governance may be merged following a 28 Day Review and Comment Period, and a 14 Day Balloting Period.

## Working Group Charters

The Maintenance Team may make or merge any Proposed change to the Governance Repository which charters a working group or, upon petitition by the Working Group, amends the charter of the Working Group, unless the proposed charter or amendment thereto does any of the following:
* Creates or modifies a process for the Working Group to make or merge changes to any repository which is not already in use for that repository,
* Authorizes the Working Group to take any action explicitly granted to any Team other than the Maintenance Team, whether or not on an exclusive basis, or modifies such a grant,
* Deprives the Maintenance team of any authority, or grants it on an exclusive basis to the Working Group,
* Without the consent of any Working Group so implicated, grants the Working Group any authority that is already granted to an existing Working Group.

Removal of a Working Group is not included in the above authority, and must be subject to the standard process for Proposed Changes to Governance.

## New Repositories

When a new repository is created by the Maintenance Team, the Maintenance Team may amend governance to establish new special processes applicable to that repository, or to apply existing processes applied to another repository to the new repository, following 14 Day Review and Comment Period, provided that:
* The new repository is of a substantially similar style to an existing repository under special governance processes, and the processes established for the new repository are markedly similar to the processes of the existing repository as applicable, or
* The new repository has non-technical, non-normative content, and the newly established processes are reasonable and do not prescribe any novel process.
