# Common Repository Operation

## Review and Comment Process

Any Action may be subjected to a Review and Comment Process for a defined length of time by the Team or Working Group authorized to take the action.

In some cases, an Action may be prescribed to be subjected to a Review and Comment Process for a prescribed length of time. 
The Team or Working Group authorized to take such an action shall initiate a Review and Comment Process that lasts for at least the prescribed length of time, but they may extend the Review and Comment Process if they deem it necessary.

During the Review and Comment Process, all Members of the Project are notified in a reasonably accessible manner, and may raise concerns. 
If an objection is raised, a member of the Review Team may second the concern. Once an concern is seconded or raised by a member of the Review Team, the Review Team must approve the action before the Review and Comment Period for the Action is deemed to have ended. 

During the Review and Comment Period, the action may be modified before the period ends, to address comments raised by Members.

## Balloting Process

Any Action may be subjected to a Balloting Process for a defined length of time by the Team or Working Group authorized to take the action. In the case of an Action taken by a Working Group, a Member of the Maintenance Team must approve the Ballotting Process. The Balloting process for an action, if any, occurs after the Review and Comment process for that action.

During the Balloting Process, all Members of the Project are notified in a reasonably accessible manner. 
The Project shall provide a method for all Members of the Project to cast a vote. 
This method shall be reasonably secured against tampering, and, except as necessary to prevent duplicate votes and to validate membership, shall not identify the member in question.

At the end of the Balloting Period, the votes of all members who voted during the period are counted. If a majority of the votes cast approve the action, the action is deemed approved, otherwise it is deemed failed. The Balloting Process may provided a method for members who vote to explicitly decline to vote on the action, and such votes are discounted.
If 2/3s or more of the total votes cast do not approve the action, the action is not deemed approved, but provided fewer than 1/3 of the total votes are against the action, a new Balloting process may be started by the group who started it originally. 

Specific Actions may specify a higher threshold of approving votes, than the required majority. The action is approved only if the required threshold is met.
